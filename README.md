The Tangem card is a self-custodial hardware wallet for blockchain assets. The main functions of Tangem cards are to securely create and store a private key from a blockchain wallet and sign blockchain transactions. The Tangem card does not allow users to import/export, backup/restore private keys, thereby guaranteeing that the wallet is unique and unclonable.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
#### iOS
iOS 11+ (CoreNFC is required), Xcode 11+
SDK can be imported to iOS 11, but it will work only since iOS 13.

#### Android
Android with minimal SDK version of 21 and a device with NFC support

### Installation
```cordova plugin add tangem-sdk```


### Usage
Tangem SDK is a self-sufficient solution that implements a card abstraction model, methods of interaction with the card and interactions with the user via UI.

The easiest way to use the SDK is to call basic methods. The basic method performs one or more operations and, after that, calls completion block with success or error.

Most of functions have the optional `cardId` argument, if it's passed the operation, it can be performed only with the card with the same card ID. If card is wrong, user will be asked to take the right card.
We recommend to set this argument if there is no special need to use any card.

When calling basic methods, there is no need to show the error to the user, since it will be displayed on the NFC popup before it's hidden.
